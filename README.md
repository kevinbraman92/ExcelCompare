# ExcelCompare
A python program that compares two Excel Workbooks and generates a combined file showing the differences between the two.

Before using, run 'runExcelCompare.bat' once to create the folders for the program. Your file structure should look something like this:

Put your Excel files in the 'ExcelFiles' folder. Run 'runExcelCompare.bat' again and follow the prompts to compare the two Excel Workbooks. 

The output of the program will appear in 'ExcelOutput' folder. 

I've included two sample Excel files you can run if you want to see the program in action. Find them in the 'SampleFiles' directory.
